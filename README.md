# Software_Engineering_project

## Software engineering project by Emma Tosato and Edoardo Signoretto

The aim of the project is to design a computer system for an agency that provides seasonal job search support services. Interested workers can register for the service by applying at the agency's counters. The system is to allow the management of master records and the search for seasonal workers, in the agriculture and tourism sectors.

Service managers, employees of the agency, enter workers' data. For each worker, biographical data (first name, last name, place and date of birth, nationality), address, personal telephone number (if any), email, any previous specializations/experience (lifeguard, bartender, swimming instructor, viticulturist, floriculturist), languages spoken, type of driver's license, and whether he or she has a car are stored. Also stored are the periods and areas (municipalities), for which the worker is available. Of each worker, the information of at least one person to be notified in case of an emergency is also stored: first name, last name, telephone, email address.

Agency employees must authenticate themselves to access the system and enter worker data. The system allows agency employees to update the master records with all the jobs that seasonal workers have held in the last 5 years. The following should be recorded for each job held: period, company name, duties performed, place of work, and gross daily wage. For agency employees, master data, email address, telephone, and login credentials (login and password) are stored.

Once worker information is recorded, agency staff can search against possible required profiles.
Specifically, the system must allow employees to search by worker, by languages spoken, period of availability, duties listed, place of residence, and availability of car/driver's license. The system must allow complex searches through the specification of different search conditions (both AND and OR).
